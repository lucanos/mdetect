            // It is not necessarily a Best Practice to use an intermediary landing and detection page like this example
            //    when using JavaScript as a detection method.

            //    Send them to the nice touch-optimized page. 
            //    These often have rich CSS and advanced but mobile-friendly JavaScript functionality and no Flash.
            // Second, detect any other mobile device. Send them to the basic mobile pages, with light CSS and no JavaScript.
            //    Some (often older) touch devices might be included in this bunch, which otherwise includes feature phones.
            //    It's a Best Practice to include an alternate web page for less-capable mobile devices. 
            // Finally, assume anything else not caught by these filters is a desktop PC-class device. 
            //    Send them to your regular home page which may include large pictures, lots of JS, Flash, etc.. 
            //
            // NOTE: If you wanted an iPad-class tablet-optimized web site, too, then you should FIRST do a 
            //    device detection using the DetectTierTablet() method. Then detect for iPhone tier, and so on. 
            
            //We have variables for certain high-usage device variables, like the iPhone Tier.
            //   You might use the device variables to show/hide certain functionality or platform-specific features and ads, etc.
            //   Alternately, you can use the method: DetectTierIphone().
